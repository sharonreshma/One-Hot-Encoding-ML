# One-Hot Encoding Machine Learning and Data Analysis Project

### Overview

This project demonstrates how to convert categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms using SpaCy, NumPy, and scikit-learn, along with performing data analysis using Pandas. One-hot encoding is a crucial preprocessing step that ensures categorical data is represented as binary vectors, which many machine learning models can interpret correctly.

### Tools and Libraries

- **SpaCy**: For preprocessing text data, tokenization, and handling various natural language processing tasks.
- **NumPy**: For creating binary arrays that represent the presence of categories.
- **scikit-learn**: For performing one-hot encoding and integrating it into machine learning pipelines.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis, particularly useful for handling CSV data.

### Outcomes

- Convert categorical data into binary arrays using NumPy.
- Use scikit-learn's `OneHotEncoder` to convert categorical data into binary vectors.
- Perform basic data analysis and manipulation on CSV data using Pandas.
